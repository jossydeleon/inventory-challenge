## About project

This project is a challenge requested by Code the Dream. It is an small app that serve as a inventory system.
End user must be capable of:

- Keep track of at least one product. Letâ€™s start with bananas.
- Manage the quantities of the product(s). There should be a way to increase and decrease the number of items of the product(s) in the inventory.
- Send an email if the quantity of a product hits zero.

## What is using?

- Typescript
- ReactJS
- Context API
- React Hooks
- Firebase (database and authentication)
- MaterialUI (User interface)
- Axios (to communicate with email backend: https://github.com/jossydeleon/nodemailer-express-app)
- React-hook-form (Form Validation Api)

## Login credentials

For simplicity, I created an admin user to access to the app. Login using this credentials

```javascript
email: johnsmith@inventory.com
pass: 123456
```

## Receive email notifications

In order to receive notifications when products hits zero:

- Login with credentials
- Go to settings
- Add the email where you want to receive notifications

### Note

- Emails will take time to arrive since the backend is hosted in Heroku free version account.
- You need to check Spam folder in your email in case notification is not received in inbox folder.
